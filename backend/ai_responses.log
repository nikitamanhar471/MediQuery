Q: 101, 1 day, no, no, no
A:
Response: Okay, a temperature of 101Â°F (38.3Â°C) for one day, with no other symptoms, and
no known medical conditions or recent exposure to illness.  That's concerning
but not necessarily a cause for immediate panic.  It's likely a mild viral
infection.

**Recommendations:**

* **Rest:** Get plenty of rest.  Your body needs energy to fight off the
infection.

* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, clear broths, or
electrolyte drinks to prevent dehydration.

* **Over-the-counter medication:** You can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to help reduce your fever and alleviate any
discomfort.  Follow the dosage instructions on the packaging carefully.

**Monitoring:**

* **Monitor your temperature:** Continue to monitor your temperature throughout
the day.  If it rises above 103Â°F (39.4Â°C), or if you develop any new symptoms
(like a severe headache, stiff neck, rash, or difficulty breathing), seek
medical attention immediately.

* **Watch for worsening symptoms:**  Pay close attention to how you feel. If
your fever persists for more than 3-5 days, or if your symptoms worsen,  please
see a doctor.

While this likely is a mild viral infection that will resolve on its own with
rest and fluids,  it's always best to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate
to contact a doctor if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don't improve.
